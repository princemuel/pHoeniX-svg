This site is made for people. As such I try my best to be AA compliant with
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag)
and in doing so, try to make the web more accessible and inclusive.

That said, I'm not perfect and I'm always learning and improving the website.
I run automated testing for accessibility issues regularly, as well as
testing on desktop and mobile browsers with different zoom levels.
